# üìä Project Overview: Customer Churn Prediction (Telecom)

- This project uses **The Orange Telecom Churn Dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mnassrib/telecom-churn-datasets), which includes pre-cleaned customer activity data along with a churn label indicating whether a customer has canceled their subscription. The objective is to analyze the factors contributing to customer churn and build predictive models to identify at-risk customers.

- Two datasets are provided:

  - churn-bigml-80.csv: 80% of the data, used for training and cross-validation.

  - churn-bigml-20.csv: 20% of the data, reserved for final testing and performance evaluation.

- Both datasets come from the same source batch and have been split for robust model development and validation.

## üîç Objectives

- Exploratory Data Analysis: Understand the underlying patterns and identify features that influence customer churn.

- Model Development: Train and evaluate various machine learning models.

- Model Selection: Identify the most accurate model for predicting future churn.
